# ML_Models
The "Parameter search.ipynb" script was used to do hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV
## Training 1
The following folders contains the first ML models that were trained useing the first dataset as explained in the paper:
### Training_1.1
This folder contains ML models trained on the first dataset
### Training_1.2
This folder contains ML models trained on the first dataset after trying the PCA method

## Training 2
The following folders contains the second ML models that were trained useing the second dataset as explained in the paper:
### Training_2.1
This folder contains ML models trained on the second dataset before transforming the output
### Training_2.2
This folder contains ML models trained on the second dataset after the transformation technique was applied
# Second dataset transformation results
The figures below present the scatter plot of X and Y coordinates vs. Flooded area (before and after the trasnformation technique)
